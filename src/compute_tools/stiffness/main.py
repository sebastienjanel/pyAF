    The code takes advantage of the multiprocessing module from python to be
    able to use multiple cores. Great care must be taken while accessing the
    data from the hdf5 file. The multiprocessing code was adapted from the
    multiprocess_access_queues.py example from pytables.

    The data can be read and written in blocks to reduce the memory footprint
    of the computation.

    In each block, queues are set up with make_queues. Then, DataProcessors are
    created (one per core), and the computation is run.

    The progressbar needs to be updated in this module (it can not be called
    from one of the child processes.

    To be compatible with windows, all the parameters for the fits are passed
    to the processors as arguments.

    Please read the documentation to get more details about the multiprocessing
