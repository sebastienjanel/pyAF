#pyAF : An AFM Force Curve Analysis Software

pyAF is a tool to analyze force curves & force maps acquired by atomic force microscopes (Bruker and JPK).
Developed at CMPI lab (https://cmpi.cnrs.fr).

It computes:
- Elasticity with several models and bottom effect correction (BEC)
- Stiffness tomography
- Work of detachment and rupture force
- Unbinding events and loading rates
- Zero-force topography
- Regions of interest for substrate definition and stats
- Curve tilt correction and smoothing
- 3D map rendering
- Text export (to R), Statistics (UNPOLISHED)
- Multi files and multiprocessing
